This is based on the
[openstreetmap-tile-server](https://github.com/Overv/openstreetmap-tile-server)
project and takes some improvements from [this
fork](https://github.com/mhajder/openstreetmap-tile-server-cyclosm).

We use this Dockerfile to run the tile servers for both our gravel
overlay and our poi overlay. They are available in the standard
distribution of the [CXB route
planner](https://cxberlin.com/routenplaner/cxb-routenplaner/).
